### Project Overview: ###
### *Tiles - Cleaning up the City. One Tile at a Time.* ###

In this 12-Hour Hackathon we aimed to solve the problem of _garbage_, something humans are constantly producing. With the development of Tile we are creating a way to gamify cleaning up garbage with a fun, interactive, team-based game. The idea being this: Lets say I claen up the garbage around the Red Robin downtown, I would take a picture of the approximate 20ft^2 area of that spot, upload it to the application where it would undergo some verification process, if the area is deemed to be clean, the corresponding square/squares become highlighted in your teams color. Team's are chosen upon account creation.
