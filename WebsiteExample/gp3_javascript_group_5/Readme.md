# GP3 - JavaScript Game Object Design
Class: CS301 â€“ Internet Applications Development

## Overview
The goal of this third group project is to finish your side-scrolling JavaScript game. 
* If this game were to be published on the WWW, you would want to attract customers to the website. 
* If your game is an educational game, you want users to easily discover how to play the game and how to access its features. 
* If you wanted advertising on this page (in order to collect revenue), you would not want the advertising to distract from the game, but, you would want customers to see it.

### Directions
1.	As a group, identify the main objects for your game. List them.
2.	What properties and methods will each object need? Do not write code yet. Design a psuedo UML diagram, like I have illustrated below, for each object. Identify the properties ( key : variable value) pairs and the methods ( key : anonymous function value) pairs. Use the Coyote object as an example. Put this in a file called Design.md and save it in your repository folder. Your class diagram (in the Design.md file) should look like this:

| aGameObjectName - short description of purpose                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| property_name_1  :  property_type_1 ( short description of propterty 1 )           |
| property_name_2  :  property_type_2 ( short description of propterty 2 )           |
| ...  :  ...                                                                        |
| method_name_1  :  anonymous function ( short description purpose of the method 1 ) |
| method_name_2  :  anonymous function ( short description purpose of the method 2 ) |
| ...  :  ...                                                                        |

3.	Design a rough outline for the main controller script flow diagram.  Do not write code yet. Make a picture/drawing called ControllerDesign.png and put a copy in your repository folder. 
4. Identify the tasks do you want your main controller script to do? (A controller script will be called roughly once every 25 ms) Here are the tasks my controller does. What do you want yours to do?
a.	Registers one or more callback functions (more on this next class)
b.	Update each objects
c.	Checks for collisions (if collisions implemented)
d.	What else do you want?
5. Now you can start working on code. Each of you should have a branch of the project. 
6. I recommed either (a) breaking into pairs and coding that way or (b) coding as a group. Make sure to share development time. 
7. Remember, each of you must have your own branch of the project! 
8. Branch early, commit and push often, and make sure to use descriptive comments each of your commits!
5.	For grading this exercise, we will look at the requirements listed above! Make sure to have someone in your group check that you are meeting the requirements!
